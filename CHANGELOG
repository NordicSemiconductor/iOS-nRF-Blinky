- **1.0.2**:
    - Improvement: Blinky peripheral name is now used as the title of the view instead of the default name
    - Improvement: Empty peripherals view resizes and animates better with orientation change
    - Improvement: Fixed a minor detail in the (Wireless by Nordic) text at the bottom of the view to avoid situations where it disappears or does not animate properly with orientation changes

- **1.0.1**:
    - Bugfix: Fixed an issue where swiping back from the peripheral view without actually dismissing would cause the app not to reconnect to the Blinky peripheral.
